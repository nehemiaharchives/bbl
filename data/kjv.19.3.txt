1 <A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many [are] they that rise up against me.
2 Many [there be] which say of my soul, [There is] no help for him in God. Selah.
3 But thou, O LORD, [art] a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set [themselves] against me round about.
7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies [upon] the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
8 Salvation [belongeth] unto the LORD: thy blessing [is] upon thy people. Selah.
