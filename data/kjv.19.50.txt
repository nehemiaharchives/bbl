1 <A Psalm of Asaph.> The mighty God, [even] the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God [is] judge himself. Selah.
7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I [am] God, [even] thy God.
8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, [to have been] continually before me.
9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, [nor] he goats out of thy folds.
10 For every beast of the forest [is] mine, [and] the cattle upon a thousand hills.
11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field [are] mine.
12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world [is] mine, and the fulness thereof.
13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or [that] thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
20 Thou sittest [and] speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
21 These [things] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether [such an one] as thyself: [but] I will reprove thee, and set [them] in order before thine eyes.
22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear [you] in pieces, and [there be] none to deliver.
23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth [his] conversation [aright] will I shew the salvation of God.
