1 A false balance [is] abomination to the LORD: but a just weight [is] his delight.
2 [When] pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly [is] wisdom.
3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.
5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in [their own] naughtiness.
7 When a wicked man dieth, [his] expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust [men] perisheth.
8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.
9 An hypocrite with [his] mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.
10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, [there is] shouting.
11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.
14 Where no counsel [is], the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors [there is] safety.
15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart [for it]: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.
16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong [men] retain riches.
17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but [he that is] cruel troubleth his own flesh.
18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness [shall be] a sure reward.
19 As righteousness [tendeth] to life: so he that pursueth evil [pursueth it] to his own death.
20 They that are of a froward heart [are] abomination to the LORD: but [such as are] upright in [their] way [are] his delight.
21 [Though] hand [join] in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
22 [As] a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, [so is] a fair woman which is without discretion.
23 The desire of the righteous [is] only good: [but] the expectation of the wicked [is] wrath.
24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and [there is] that withholdeth more than is meet, but [it tendeth] to poverty.
25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing [shall be] upon the head of him that selleth [it].
27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.
28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool [shall be] servant to the wise of heart.
30 The fruit of the righteous [is] a tree of life; and he that winneth souls [is] wise.
31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
