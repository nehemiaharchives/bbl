1 <To the chief Musician upon Neginah, [A Psalm] of David.> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock [that] is higher than I.
3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, [and] a strong tower from the enemy.
4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given [me] the heritage of those that fear thy name.
6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: [and] his years as many generations.
7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, [which] may preserve him.
8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
