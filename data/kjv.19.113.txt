1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name [is] to be praised.
4 The LORD [is] high above all nations, [and] his glory above the heavens.
5 Who [is] like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
6 Who humbleth [himself] to behold [the things that are] in heaven, and in the earth!
7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
8 That he may set [him] with princes, [even] with the princes of his people.
9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, [and to be] a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
