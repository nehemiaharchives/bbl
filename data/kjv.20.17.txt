1 Better [is] a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices [with] strife.
2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
3 The fining pot [is] for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.
4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; [and] a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: [and] he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
6 Children's children [are] the crown of old men; and the glory of children [are] their fathers.
7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.
8 A gift [is as] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth [very] friends.
10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.
11 An evil [man] seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.
13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
14 The beginning of strife [is as] when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both [are] abomination to the LORD.
16 Wherefore [is there] a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing [he hath] no heart [to it]?
17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, [and] becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: [and] he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
21 He that begetteth a fool [doeth it] to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
22 A merry heart doeth good [like] a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
23 A wicked [man] taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
24 Wisdom [is] before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool [are] in the ends of the earth.
25 A foolish son [is] a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
26 Also to punish the just [is] not good, [nor] to strike princes for equity.
27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: [and] a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: [and] he that shutteth his lips [is esteemed] a man of understanding.
