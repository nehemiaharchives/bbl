1 The king's heart [is] in the hand of the LORD, [as] the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
2 Every way of a man [is] right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
3 To do justice and judgment [is] more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
4 An high look, and a proud heart, [and] the plowing of the wicked, [is] sin.
5 The thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness; but of every one [that is] hasty only to want.
6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue [is] a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
8 The way of man [is] froward and strange: but [as for] the pure, his work [is] right.
9 [It is] better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
12 The righteous [man] wisely considereth the house of the wicked: [but God] overthroweth the wicked for [their] wickedness.
13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
15 [It is] joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction [shall be] to the workers of iniquity.
16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
17 He that loveth pleasure [shall be] a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
18 The wicked [shall be] a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
19 [It is] better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.
20 [There is] treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
22 A wise [man] scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
24 Proud [and] haughty scorner [is] his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.
25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.
26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.
27 The sacrifice of the wicked [is] abomination: how much more, [when] he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but [as for] the upright, he directeth his way.
30 [There is] no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.
31 The horse [is] prepared against the day of battle: but safety [is] of the LORD.
