1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
2 For the transgression of a land many [are] the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding [and] knowledge the state [thereof] shall be prolonged.
3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor [is like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all [things].
6 Better [is] the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than [he that is] perverse [in his] ways, though he [be] rich.
7 Whoso keepeth the law [is] a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous [men] shameth his father.
8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer [shall be] abomination.
10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good [things] in possession.
11 The rich man [is] wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
12 When righteous [men] do rejoice, [there is] great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh [them] shall have mercy.
14 Happy [is] the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
15 [As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; [so is] a wicked ruler over the poor people.
16 The prince that wanteth understanding [is] also a great oppressor: [but] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong [his] days.
17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of [any] person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but [he that is] perverse [in his] ways shall fall at once.
19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough.
20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
21 To have respect of persons [is] not good: for for a piece of bread [that] man will transgress.
22 He that hasteth to be rich [hath] an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.
24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, [It is] no transgression; the same [is] the companion of a destroyer.
25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
