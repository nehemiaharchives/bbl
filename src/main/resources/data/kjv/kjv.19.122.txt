1 <A Song of degrees of David.> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
7 Peace be within thy walls, [and] prosperity within thy palaces.
8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace [be] within thee.
9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
