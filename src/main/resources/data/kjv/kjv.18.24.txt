1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
2 [Some] remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed [thereof].
3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
5 Behold, [as] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness [yieldeth] food for them [and] for [their] children.
6 They reap [every one] his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that [they have] no covering in the cold.
8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
10 They cause [him] to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf [from] the hungry;
11 [Which] make oil within their walls, [and] tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst.
12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly [to them].
13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth [his] face.
16 In the dark they dig through houses, [which] they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
17 For the morning [is] to them even as the shadow of death: if [one] know [them, they are in] the terrors of the shadow of death.
18 He [is] swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [so doth] the grave [those which] have sinned.
20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
21 He evil entreateth the barren [that] beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no [man] is sure of life.
23 [Though] it be given him [to be] in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes [are] upon their ways.
24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all [other], and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
25 And if [it be] not [so] now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
