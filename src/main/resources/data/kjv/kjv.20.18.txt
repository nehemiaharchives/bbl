1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh [and] intermeddleth with all wisdom.
2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
3 When the wicked cometh, [then] cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
4 The words of a man's mouth [are as] deep waters, [and] the wellspring of wisdom [as] a flowing brook.
5 [It is] not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
7 A fool's mouth [is] his destruction, and his lips [are] the snare of his soul.
8 The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
10 The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
11 The rich man's wealth [is] his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour [is] humility.
13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth [it], it [is] folly and shame unto him.
14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
17 [He that is] first in his own cause [seemeth] just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
19 A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city: and [their] contentions [are] like the bars of a castle.
20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; [and] with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
21 Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
22 [Whoso] findeth a wife findeth a good [thing], and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
24 A man [that hath] friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend [that] sticketh closer than a brother.
