1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth [between] the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
2 The LORD [is] great in Zion; and he [is] high above all the people.
3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; [for] it [is] holy.
4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; [for] he [is] holy.
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance [that] he gave them.
8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God [is] holy.
