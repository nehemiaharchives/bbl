1 <To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm [or] Song.> God be merciful unto us, and bless us; [and] cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
6 [Then] shall the earth yield her increase; [and] God, [even] our own God, shall bless us.
7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
