1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: because his mercy [endureth] for ever.
2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy [endureth] for ever.
3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy [endureth] for ever.
4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy [endureth] for ever.
5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, [and set me] in a large place.
6 The LORD [is] on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see [my desire] upon them that hate me.
8 [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
9 [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
12 They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
14 The LORD [is] my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation [is] in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, [and] I will praise the LORD:
20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
22 The stone [which] the builders refused is become the head [stone] of the corner.
23 This is the LORD'S doing; it [is] marvellous in our eyes.
24 This [is] the day [which] the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
26 Blessed [be] he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
27 God [is] the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, [even] unto the horns of the altar.
28 Thou [art] my God, and I will praise thee: [thou art] my God, I will exalt thee.
29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
