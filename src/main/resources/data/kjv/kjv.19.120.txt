1 <A Song of degrees.> In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, [and] from a deceitful tongue.
3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, [that] I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
7 I [am for] peace: but when I speak, they [are] for war.
