1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
4 Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mingled.
6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [man getteth] himself a blot.
8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
9 Give [instruction] to a wise [man], and he will be yet wiser: teach a just [man], and he will increase in learning.
10 The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy [is] understanding.
11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it].
13 A foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knoweth nothing.
14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
15 To call passengers who go right on their ways:
16 Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: and [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.
18 But he knoweth not that the dead [are] there; [and that] her guests [are] in the depths of hell.
