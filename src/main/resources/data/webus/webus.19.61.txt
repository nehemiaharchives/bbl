1 Hear my cry, God.
 Listen to my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed.
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
3 For you have been a refuge for me,
 a strong tower from the enemy.
4 I will dwell in your tent forever.
 I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah.
5 For you, God, have heard my vows.
 You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
6 You will prolong the king’s life.
 His years will be for generations.
7 He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever.
 Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
8 So I will sing praise to your name forever,
 that I may fulfill my vows daily.
