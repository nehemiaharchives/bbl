1 I was glad when they said to me,
 “Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!”
2 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem!
3 Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together,
4 where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes,
 according to an ordinance for Israel,
 to give thanks to Yahweh’s name.
5 For there are set thrones for judgment,
 the thrones of David’s house.
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
 Those who love you will prosper.
7 Peace be within your walls,
 and prosperity within your palaces.
8 For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,
 I will now say, “Peace be within you.”
9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God,
 I will seek your good.
