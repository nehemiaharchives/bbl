1 Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?
 God’s loving kindness endures continually.
2 Your tongue plots destruction,
 like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
3 You love evil more than good,
 lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.
4 You love all devouring words,
 you deceitful tongue.
5 God will likewise destroy you forever.
 He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,
 and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.
6 The righteous also will see it, and fear,
 and laugh at him, saying,
7 “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,
 but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
 and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”
8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.
 I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.
9 I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.
 I will hope in your name, for it is good,
 in the presence of your saints.
