1 “Listen to this, you priests!
 Listen, house of Israel,
 and give ear, house of the king!
 For the judgment is against you;
 for you have been a snare at Mizpah,
 and a net spread on Tabor.
2 The rebels are deep in slaughter,
 but I discipline all of them.
3 I know Ephraim,
 and Israel is not hidden from me;
 for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.
 Israel is defiled.
4 Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God,
 for the spirit of prostitution is within them,
 and they don’t know Yahweh.
5 The pride of Israel testifies to his face.
 Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.
 Judah also will stumble with them.
6 They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh,
 but they won’t find him.
 He has withdrawn himself from them.
7 They are unfaithful to Yahweh;
 for they have borne illegitimate children.
 Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.
8 “Blow the cornet in Gibeah,
 and the trumpet in Ramah!
 Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!
9 Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.
 Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.
10 The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.
 I will pour out my wrath on them like water.
11 Ephraim is oppressed,
 he is crushed in judgment,
 because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.
12 Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,
 and to the house of Judah like rottenness.
13 “When Ephraim saw his sickness,
 and Judah his wound,
 then Ephraim went to Assyria,
 and sent to King Jareb:
 but he is not able to heal you,
 neither will he cure you of your wound.
14 For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,
 and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
 I myself will tear in pieces and go away.
 I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.
15 I will go and return to my place,
 until they acknowledge their offense,
 and seek my face.
 In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”
