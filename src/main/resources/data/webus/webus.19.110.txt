1 Yahweh says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,
 until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.”
2 Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion.
 Rule among your enemies.
3 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array.
 Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.
4 Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind:
 “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
5 The Lord is at your right hand.
 He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.
6 He will judge among the nations.
 He will heap up dead bodies.
 He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
7 He will drink of the brook on the way;
 therefore he will lift up his head.
