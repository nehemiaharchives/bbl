1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.
 Give me relief from my distress.
 Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.
2 You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
 Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah.
3 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly;
 Yahweh will hear when I call to him.
4 Stand in awe, and don’t sin.
 Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.
5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.
 Put your trust in Yahweh.
6 Many say, “Who will show us any good?”
 Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.
7 You have put gladness in my heart,
 more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.
8 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,
 for you alone, Yahweh, make me live in safety.
