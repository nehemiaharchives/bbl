1 Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!
 Many are those who rise up against me.
2 Many there are who say of my soul,
 “There is no help for him in God.”  Selah.
3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,
 my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
4 I cry to Yahweh with my voice,
 and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.
5 I laid myself down and slept.
 I awakened, for Yahweh sustains me.
6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people
 who have set themselves against me on every side.
7 Arise, Yahweh!
 Save me, my God!
 For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.
 You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
8 Salvation belongs to Yahweh.
 May your blessing be on your people. Selah.
