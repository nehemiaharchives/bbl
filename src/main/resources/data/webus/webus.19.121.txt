1 I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
 Where does my help come from?
2 My help comes from Yahweh,
 who made heaven and earth.
3 He will not allow your foot to be moved.
 He who keeps you will not slumber.
4 Behold, he who keeps Israel
 will neither slumber nor sleep.
5 Yahweh is your keeper.
 Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
6 The sun will not harm you by day,
 nor the moon by night.
7 Yahweh will keep you from all evil.
 He will keep your soul.
8 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in,
 from this time forward, and forever more.
