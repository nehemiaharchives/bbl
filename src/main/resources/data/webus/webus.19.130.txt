1 Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.
2 Lord, hear my voice.
 Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.
3 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins,
 Lord, who could stand?
4 But there is forgiveness with you,
 therefore you are feared.
5 I wait for Yahweh.
 My soul waits.
 I hope in his word.
6 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning,
 more than watchmen for the morning.
7 Israel, hope in Yahweh,
 for there is loving kindness with Yahweh.
 Abundant redemption is with him.
8 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
