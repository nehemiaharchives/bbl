1 In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.
 He answered me.
2 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips,
 from a deceitful tongue.
3 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,
 you deceitful tongue?
4 Sharp arrows of the mighty,
 with coals of juniper.
5 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,
 that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
6 My soul has had her dwelling too long
 with him who hates peace.
7 I am for peace,
 but when I speak, they are for war.
