1 We give thanks to you, God.
 We give thanks, for your Name is near.
 Men tell about your wondrous works.
2 When I choose the appointed time,
 I will judge blamelessly.
3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
 I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.
4 I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”
 I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.
5 Don’t lift up your horn on high.
 Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”
6 For neither from the east, nor from the west,
 nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
7 But God is the judge.
 He puts down one, and lifts up another.
8 For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup,
 full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
 He pours it out.
 Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
9 But I will declare this forever:
 I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
 but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
