1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
2 “Dominion and fear are with him.
 He makes peace in his high places.
3 Can his armies be counted?
 On whom does his light not arise?
4 How then can man be just with God?
 Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?
5 Behold, even the moon has no brightness,
 and the stars are not pure in his sight;
6 How much less man, who is a worm,
 and the son of man, who is a worm!”
