1 Praise Yahweh!
 Sing to Yahweh a new song,
 his praise in the assembly of the saints.
2 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.
 Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
3 Let them praise his name in the dance!
 Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp!
4 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.
 He crowns the humble with salvation.
5 Let the saints rejoice in honor.
 Let them sing for joy on their beds.
6 May the high praises of God be in their mouths,
 and a two-edged sword in their hand,
7 to execute vengeance on the nations,
 and punishments on the peoples;
8 to bind their kings with chains,
 and their nobles with fetters of iron;
9 to execute on them the written judgment.
 All his saints have this honor.
 Praise Yah!
