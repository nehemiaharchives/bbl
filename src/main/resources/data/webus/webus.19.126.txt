1 When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,
 we were like those who dream.
2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
 and our tongue with singing.
 Then they said among the nations,
 “Yahweh has done great things for them.”
3 Yahweh has done great things for us,
 and we are glad.
4 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,
 like the streams in the Negev.
5 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
6 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,
 will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
