1 Deliver me, Yahweh, from evil men.
 Preserve me from violent men:
2 those who devise mischief in their hearts.
 They continually gather themselves together for war.
3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.
 Viper’s poison is under their lips. Selah.
4 Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.
 Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
5 The proud have hidden a snare for me,
 they have spread the cords of a net by the path.
 They have set traps for me. Selah.
6 I said to Yahweh, “You are my God.”
 Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh.
7 Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
 you have covered my head in the day of battle.
8 Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked.
 Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah.
9 As for the head of those who surround me,
 let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
10 Let burning coals fall on them.
 Let them be thrown into the fire,
 into miry pits, from where they never rise.
11 An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth.
 Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
12 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
 and justice for the needy.
13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.
 The upright will dwell in your presence.
