1 Unless Yahweh builds the house,
 they who build it labor in vain.
 Unless Yahweh watches over the city,
 the watchman guards it in vain.
2 It is vain for you to rise up early,
 to stay up late,
 eating the bread of toil,
 for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
3 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.
 The fruit of the womb is his reward.
4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
 so are the children of youth.
5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.
 They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
