1 I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice,
 and my cries for mercy.
2 Because he has turned his ear to me,
 therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
3 The cords of death surrounded me,
 the pains of Sheol got a hold of me.
 I found trouble and sorrow.
4 Then I called on Yahweh’s name:
 “Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul.”
5 Yahweh is gracious and righteous.
 Yes, our God is merciful.
6 Yahweh preserves the simple.
 I was brought low, and he saved me.
7 Return to your rest, my soul,
 for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.
8 For you have delivered my soul from death,
 my eyes from tears,
 and my feet from falling.
9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
10 I believed, therefore I said,
 “I was greatly afflicted.”
11 I said in my haste,
 “All people are liars.”
12 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?
13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on Yahweh’s name.
14 I will pay my vows to Yahweh,
 yes, in the presence of all his people.
15 Precious in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his saints.
16 Yahweh, truly I am your servant.
 I am your servant, the son of your servant girl.
 You have freed me from my chains.
17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
 and will call on Yahweh’s name.
18 I will pay my vows to Yahweh,
 yes, in the presence of all his people,
19 in the courts of Yahweh’s house,
 in the middle of you, Jerusalem.
 Praise Yah!
