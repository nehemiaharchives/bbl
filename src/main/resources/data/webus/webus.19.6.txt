1 Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger,
 neither discipline me in your wrath.
2 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint.
 Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
3 My soul is also in great anguish.
 But you, Yahweh—how long?
4 Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul,
 and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.
5 For in death there is no memory of you.
 In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?
6 I am weary with my groaning.
 Every night I flood my bed.
 I drench my couch with my tears.
7 My eye wastes away because of grief.
 It grows old because of all my adversaries.
8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,
 for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.
9 Yahweh has heard my supplication.
 Yahweh accepts my prayer.
10 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.
 They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
