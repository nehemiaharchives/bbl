1 The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness;
 the world, and those who dwell in it.
2 For he has founded it on the seas,
 and established it on the floods.
3 Who may ascend to Yahweh’s hill?
 Who may stand in his holy place?
4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart;
 who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,
 and has not sworn deceitfully.
5 He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh,
 righteousness from the God of his salvation.
6 This is the generation of those who seek Him,
 who seek your face—even Jacob. Selah.
7 Lift up your heads, you gates!
 Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,
 and the King of glory will come in.
8 Who is the King of glory?
 Yahweh strong and mighty,
 Yahweh mighty in battle.
9 Lift up your heads, you gates;
 yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors,
 and the King of glory will come in.
10 Who is this King of glory?
 Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory! Selah.
