1 Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,
 nor stand on the path of sinners,
 nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
2 but his delight is in Yahweh’s law.
 On his law he meditates day and night.
3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
 that produces its fruit in its season,
 whose leaf also does not wither.
 Whatever he does shall prosper.
4 The wicked are not so,
 but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
 nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
6 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,
 but the way of the wicked shall perish.
