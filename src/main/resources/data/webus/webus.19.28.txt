1 To you, Yahweh, I call.
 My rock, don’t be deaf to me,
 lest, if you are silent to me,
 I would become like those who go down into the pit.
2 Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you,
 when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
3 Don’t draw me away with the wicked,
 with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors,
 but mischief is in their hearts.
4 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings.
 Give them according to the operation of their hands.
 Bring back on them what they deserve.
5 Because they don’t respect the works of Yahweh,
 nor the operation of his hands,
 he will break them down and not build them up.
6 Blessed be Yahweh,
 because he has heard the voice of my petitions.
7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield.
 My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped.
 Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.
 With my song I will thank him.
8 Yahweh is their strength.
 He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
9 Save your people,
 and bless your inheritance.
 Be their shepherd also,
 and bear them up forever.
