1 Hurry, God, to deliver me.
 Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.
2 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.
 Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
3 Let them be turned because of their shame
 who say, “Aha! Aha!”
4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
 Let those who love your salvation continually say,
 “Let God be exalted!”
5 But I am poor and needy.
 Come to me quickly, God.
 You are my help and my deliverer.
 Yahweh, don’t delay.
