1 If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,
 let Israel now say,
2 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,
 when men rose up against us,
3 then they would have swallowed us up alive,
 when their wrath was kindled against us,
4 then the waters would have overwhelmed us,
 the stream would have gone over our soul.
5 Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
6 Blessed be Yahweh,
 who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
7 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.
 The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
8 Our help is in Yahweh’s name,
 who made heaven and earth.
