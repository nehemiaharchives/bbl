1 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble.
 May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,
2 send you help from the sanctuary,
 grant you support from Zion,
3 remember all your offerings,
 and accept your burned sacrifice. Selah.
4 May he grant you your heart’s desire,
 and fulfill all your counsel.
5 We will triumph in your salvation.
 In the name of our God, we will set up our banners.
 May Yahweh grant all your requests.
6 Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.
 He will answer him from his holy heaven,
 with the saving strength of his right hand.
7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,
 but we trust in the name of Yahweh our God.
8 They are bowed down and fallen,
 but we rise up, and stand upright.
9 Save, Yahweh!
 Let the King answer us when we call!
