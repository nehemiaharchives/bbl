1 See how good and how pleasant it is
 for brothers to live together in unity!
2 It is like the precious oil on the head,
 that ran down on the beard,
 even Aaron’s beard,
 that came down on the edge of his robes,
3 like the dew of Hermon,
 that comes down on the hills of Zion;
 for there Yahweh gives the blessing,
 even life forever more.
