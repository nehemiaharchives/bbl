1 Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly.
2 He said,
 “I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.
 He answered me.
 Out of the belly of Sheol I cried.
 You heard my voice.
3 For you threw me into the depths,
 in the heart of the seas.
 The flood was all around me.
 All your waves and your billows passed over me.
4 I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight;
 yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’
5 The waters surrounded me,
 even to the soul.
 The deep was around me.
 The weeds were wrapped around my head.
6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.
 The earth barred me in forever;
 yet you have brought my life up from the pit, Yahweh my God.
7 “When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.
 My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.
8 Those who regard vain idols forsake their own mercy.
9 But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
 I will pay that which I have vowed.
 Salvation belongs to Yahweh.”
10 Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
