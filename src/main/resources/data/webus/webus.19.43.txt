1 Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.
 Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?
 Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
3 Oh, send out your light and your truth.
 Let them lead me.
 Let them bring me to your holy hill,
 to your tents.
4 Then I will go to the altar of God,
 to God, my exceeding joy.
 I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
5 Why are you in despair, my soul?
 Why are you disturbed within me?
 Hope in God!
 For I shall still praise him:
 my Savior, my helper, and my God.
