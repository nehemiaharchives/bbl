1 God presides in the great assembly.
 He judges among the gods.
2 “How long will you judge unjustly,
 and show partiality to the wicked?” Selah.
3 “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.
 Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
4 Rescue the weak and needy.
 Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”
5 They don’t know, neither do they understand.
 They walk back and forth in darkness.
 All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
6 I said, “You are gods,
 all of you are sons of the Most High.
7 Nevertheless you shall die like men,
 and fall like one of the rulers.”
8 Arise, God, judge the earth,
 for you inherit all of the nations.
