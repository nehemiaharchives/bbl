1 Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,
 which can’t be moved, but remains forever.
2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
 so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.
3 For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous,
 so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.
4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,
 to those who are upright in their hearts.
5 But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways,
 Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.
 Peace be on Israel.
