1 Oh come, let’s sing to Yahweh.
 Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!
2 Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving.
 Let’s extol him with songs!
3 For Yahweh is a great God,
 a great King above all gods.
4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth.
 The heights of the mountains are also his.
5 The sea is his, and he made it.
 His hands formed the dry land.
6 Oh come, let’s worship and bow down.
 Let’s kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,
7 for he is our God.
 We are the people of his pasture,
 and the sheep in his care.
 Today, oh that you would hear his voice!
8 Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah,
 as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
9 when your fathers tempted me,
 tested me, and saw my work.
10 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,
 and said, “They are a people who err in their heart.
 They have not known my ways.”
11 Therefore I swore in my wrath,
 “They won’t enter into my rest.”
