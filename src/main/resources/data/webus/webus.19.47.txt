1 Oh clap your hands, all you nations.
 Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
2 For Yahweh Most High is awesome.
 He is a great King over all the earth.
3 He subdues nations under us,
 and peoples under our feet.
4 He chooses our inheritance for us,
 the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
5 God has gone up with a shout,
 Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
6 Sing praises to God! Sing praises!
 Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!
7 For God is the King of all the earth.
 Sing praises with understanding.
8 God reigns over the nations.
 God sits on his holy throne.
9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together,
 the people of the God of Abraham.
 For the shields of the earth belong to God.
 He is greatly exalted!
