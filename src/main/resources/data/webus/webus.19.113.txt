1 Praise Yah!
 Praise, you servants of Yahweh,
 praise Yahweh’s name.
2 Blessed be Yahweh’s name,
 from this time forward and forever more.
3 From the rising of the sun to its going down,
 Yahweh’s name is to be praised.
4 Yahweh is high above all nations,
 his glory above the heavens.
5 Who is like Yahweh, our God,
 who has his seat on high,
6 who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
7 He raises up the poor out of the dust,
 and lifts up the needy from the ash heap,
8 that he may set him with princes,
 even with the princes of his people.
9 He settles the barren woman in her home
 as a joyful mother of children.
 Praise Yah!
