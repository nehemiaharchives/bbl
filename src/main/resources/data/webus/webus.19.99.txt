1 Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble.
 He sits enthroned among the cherubim.
 Let the earth be moved.
2 Yahweh is great in Zion.
 He is high above all the peoples.
3 Let them praise your great and awesome name.
 He is Holy!
4 The King’s strength also loves justice.
 You establish equity.
 You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.
5 Exalt Yahweh our God.
 Worship at his footstool.
 He is Holy!
6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests,
 Samuel was among those who call on his name.
 They called on Yahweh, and he answered them.
7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.
 They kept his testimonies,
 the statute that he gave them.
8 You answered them, Yahweh our God.
 You are a God who forgave them,
 although you took vengeance for their doings.
9 Exalt Yahweh, our God.
 Worship at his holy hill,
 for Yahweh, our God, is holy!
