1 When Israel went out of Egypt,
 the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language,
2 Judah became his sanctuary,
 Israel his dominion.
3 The sea saw it, and fled.
 The Jordan was driven back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams,
 the little hills like lambs.
5 What was it, you sea, that you fled?
 You Jordan, that you turned back?
6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams?
 You little hills, like lambs?
7 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,
 at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 who turned the rock into a pool of water,
 the flint into a spring of waters.
