1 Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.
 Let Israel now say:
2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,
 yet they have not prevailed against me.
3 The plowers plowed on my back.
 They made their furrows long.
4 Yahweh is righteous.
 He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward,
 all those who hate Zion.
6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops,
 which withers before it grows up,
7 with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,
 nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
8 Neither do those who go by say,
 “The blessing of Yahweh be on you.
 We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
