1 I will give you thanks with my whole heart.
 Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
2 I will bow down toward your holy temple,
 and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;
 for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
3 In the day that I called, you answered me.
 You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
4 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,
 for they have heard the words of your mouth.
5 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh,
 for Yahweh’s glory is great!
6 For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;
 but he knows the proud from afar.
7 Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me.
 You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies.
 Your right hand will save me.
8 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me.
 Your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.
 Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.
