1 I cry with my voice to Yahweh.
 With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
2 I pour out my complaint before him.
 I tell him my troubles.
3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
 you knew my route.
 On the path in which I walk,
 they have hidden a snare for me.
4 Look on my right, and see;
 for there is no one who is concerned for me.
 Refuge has fled from me.
 No one cares for my soul.
5 I cried to you, Yahweh.
 I said, “You are my refuge,
 my portion in the land of the living.”
6 Listen to my cry,
 for I am in desperate need.
 Deliver me from my persecutors,
 for they are too strong for me.
7 Bring my soul out of prison,
 that I may give thanks to your name.
 The righteous will surround me,
 for you will be good to me.
