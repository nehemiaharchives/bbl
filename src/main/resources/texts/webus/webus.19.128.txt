1 Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,
 who walks in his ways.
2 For you will eat the labor of your hands.
 You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
3 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house,
 your children like olive shoots around your table.
4 Behold, this is how the man who fears Yahweh is blessed.
5 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion,
 and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
6 Yes, may you see your children’s children.
 Peace be upon Israel.
