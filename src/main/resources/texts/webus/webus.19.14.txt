1 The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”
 They are corrupt.
 They have done abominable deeds.
 There is no one who does good.
2 Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men,
 to see if there were any who understood,
 who sought after God.
3 They have all gone aside.
 They have together become corrupt.
 There is no one who does good, no, not one.
4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
 who eat up my people as they eat bread,
 and don’t call on Yahweh?
5 There they were in great fear,
 for God is in the generation of the righteous.
6 You frustrate the plan of the poor,
 because Yahweh is his refuge.
7 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
 When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people,
 then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
