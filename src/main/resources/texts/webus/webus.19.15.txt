1 Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?
 Who shall live on your holy hill?
2 He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,
 and speaks truth in his heart;
3 he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,
 nor does evil to his friend,
 nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
4 in whose eyes a vile man is despised,
 but who honors those who fear Yahweh;
 he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;
5 he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,
 nor take a bribe against the innocent.
 He who does these things shall never be shaken.
