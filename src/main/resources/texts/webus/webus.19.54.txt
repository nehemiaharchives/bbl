1 Save me, God, by your name.
 Vindicate me in your might.
2 Hear my prayer, God.
 Listen to the words of my mouth.
3 For strangers have risen up against me.
 Violent men have sought after my soul.
 They haven’t set God before them. Selah.
4 Behold, God is my helper.
 The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.
5 He will repay the evil to my enemies.
 Destroy them in your truth.
6 With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.
 I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.
7 For he has delivered me out of all trouble.
 My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
