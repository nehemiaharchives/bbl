1 Yahweh is my shepherd;
 I shall lack nothing.
2 He makes me lie down in green pastures.
 He leads me beside still waters.
3 He restores my soul.
 He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
 I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
 Your rod and your staff,
 they comfort me.
5 You prepare a table before me
 in the presence of my enemies.
 You anoint my head with oil.
 My cup runs over.
6 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life,
 and I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever.
