1 Yahweh, I have called on you.
 Come to me quickly!
 Listen to my voice when I call to you.
2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense;
 the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
3 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.
 Keep the door of my lips.
4 Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing,
 to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity.
 Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.
5 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness;
 let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head;
 don’t let my head refuse it;
 Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.
 They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
7 “As when one plows and breaks up the earth,
 our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”
8 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.
 I take refuge in you.
 Don’t leave my soul destitute.
9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
 from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
10 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets
 while I pass by.
