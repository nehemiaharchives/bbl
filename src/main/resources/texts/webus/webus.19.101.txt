1 I will sing of loving kindness and justice.
 To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.
2 I will be careful to live a blameless life.
 When will you come to me?
 I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
3 I will set no vile thing before my eyes.
 I hate the deeds of faithless men.
 They will not cling to me.
4 A perverse heart will be far from me.
 I will have nothing to do with evil.
5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.
 I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited.
6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land,
 that they may dwell with me.
 He who walks in a perfect way,
 he will serve me.
7 He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house.
 He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes.
8 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land,
 to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh’s city.
