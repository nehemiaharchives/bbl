1 In Yahweh, I take refuge.
 How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”?
2 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.
 They set their arrows on the strings,
 that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
3 If the foundations are destroyed,
 what can the righteous do?
4 Yahweh is in his holy temple.
 Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.
 His eyes observe.
 His eyes examine the children of men.
5 Yahweh examines the righteous,
 but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.
6 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;
 fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
7 For Yahweh is righteous.
 He loves righteousness.
 The upright shall see his face.
