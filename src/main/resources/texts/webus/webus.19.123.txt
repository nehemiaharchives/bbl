1 I lift up my eyes to you,
 you who sit in the heavens.
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
 as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,
 so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God,
 until he has mercy on us.
3 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,
 for we have endured much contempt.
4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,
 with the contempt of the proud.
