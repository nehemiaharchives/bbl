1 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
 You have set your glory above the heavens!
2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,
 because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.
3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,
 the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,
4 what is man, that you think of him?
 What is the son of man, that you care for him?
5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels,
 and crowned him with glory and honor.
6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
 You have put all things under his feet:
7 All sheep and cattle,
 yes, and the animals of the field,
8 the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,
 and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
9 Yahweh, our Lord,
 how majestic is your name in all the earth!
