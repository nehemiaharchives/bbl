1 Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands!
2 Serve Yahweh with gladness.
 Come before his presence with singing.
3 Know that Yahweh, he is God.
 It is he who has made us, and we are his.
 We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
 and into his courts with praise.
 Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
5 For Yahweh is good.
 His loving kindness endures forever,
 his faithfulness to all generations.
