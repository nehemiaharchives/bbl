1 Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity.
 I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
2 Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.
 Try my heart and my mind.
3 For your loving kindness is before my eyes.
 I have walked in your truth.
4 I have not sat with deceitful men,
 neither will I go in with hypocrites.
5 I hate the assembly of evildoers,
 and will not sit with the wicked.
6 I will wash my hands in innocence,
 so I will go about your altar, Yahweh,
7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard
 and tell of all your wondrous deeds.
8 Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house,
 the place where your glory dwells.
9 Don’t gather my soul with sinners,
 nor my life with bloodthirsty men
10 in whose hands is wickedness;
 their right hand is full of bribes.
11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.
 Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
12 My foot stands in an even place.
 In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
