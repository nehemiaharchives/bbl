1 Yahweh reigns!
 He is clothed with majesty!
 Yahweh is armed with strength.
 The world also is established.
 It can’t be moved.
2 Your throne is established from long ago.
 You are from everlasting.
3 The floods have lifted up, Yahweh,
 the floods have lifted up their voice.
 The floods lift up their waves.
4 Above the voices of many waters,
 the mighty breakers of the sea,
 Yahweh on high is mighty.
5 Your statutes stand firm.
 Holiness adorns your house,
 Yahweh, forever more.
