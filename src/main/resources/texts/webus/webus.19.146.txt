1 Praise Yah!
 Praise Yahweh, my soul.
2 While I live, I will praise Yahweh.
 I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
3 Don’t put your trust in princes,
 in a son of man in whom there is no help.
4 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.
 In that very day, his thoughts perish.
5 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help,
 whose hope is in Yahweh, his God,
6 who made heaven and earth,
 the sea, and all that is in them;
 who keeps truth forever;
7 who executes justice for the oppressed;
 who gives food to the hungry.
 Yahweh frees the prisoners.
8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.
 Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down.
 Yahweh loves the righteous.
9 Yahweh preserves the foreigners.
 He upholds the fatherless and widow,
 but he turns the way of the wicked upside down.
10 Yahweh will reign forever;
 your God, O Zion, to all generations.
 Praise Yah!
