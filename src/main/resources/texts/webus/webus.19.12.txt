1 Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.
 For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
2 Everyone lies to his neighbor.
 They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
3 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,
 and the tongue that boasts,
4 who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.
 Our lips are our own.
 Who is lord over us?”
5 “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,
 I will now arise,” says Yahweh;
 “I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”
6 Yahweh’s words are flawless words,
 as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
7 You will keep them, Yahweh.
 You will preserve them from this generation forever.
8 The wicked walk on every side,
 when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
