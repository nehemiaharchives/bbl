1 Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.
 All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,
 for they are many who fight proudly against me.
3 When I am afraid,
 I will put my trust in you.
4 In God, I praise his word.
 In God, I put my trust.
 I will not be afraid.
 What can flesh do to me?
5 All day long they twist my words.
 All their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They conspire and lurk,
 watching my steps.
 They are eager to take my life.
7 Shall they escape by iniquity?
 In anger cast down the peoples, God.
8 You count my wanderings.
 You put my tears into your container.
 Aren’t they in your book?
9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.
 I know this: that God is for me.
10 In God, I will praise his word.
 In Yahweh, I will praise his word.
11 I have put my trust in God.
 I will not be afraid.
 What can man do to me?
12 Your vows are on me, God.
 I will give thank offerings to you.
13 For you have delivered my soul from death,
 and prevented my feet from falling,
 that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
