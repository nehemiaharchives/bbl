1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.
2 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
3 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah.
4 I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me.
 Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:
 “This one was born there.”
5 Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;”
 the Most High himself will establish her.
6 Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples,
 “This one was born there.” Selah.
7 Those who sing as well as those who dance say,
 “All my springs are in you.”
