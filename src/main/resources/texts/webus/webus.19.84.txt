1 How lovely are your dwellings,
 Yahweh of Armies!
2 My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh.
 My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
3 Yes, the sparrow has found a home,
 and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young,
 near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.
4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house.
 They are always praising you. Selah.
5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you,
 who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.
6 Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs.
 Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
7 They go from strength to strength.
 Every one of them appears before God in Zion.
8 Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.
 Listen, God of Jacob. Selah.
9 Behold, God our shield,
 look at the face of your anointed.
10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.
 I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
 than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
11 For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.
 Yahweh will give grace and glory.
 He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.
12 Yahweh of Armies,
 blessed is the man who trusts in you.
