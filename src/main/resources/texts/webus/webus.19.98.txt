1 Sing to Yahweh a new song,
 for he has done marvelous things!
 His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
2 Yahweh has made known his salvation.
 He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
3 He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel.
 All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth!
 Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises!
5 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp,
 with the harp and the voice of melody.
6 With trumpets and sound of the ram’s horn,
 make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh.
7 Let the sea roar with its fullness;
 the world, and those who dwell therein.
8 Let the rivers clap their hands.
 Let the mountains sing for joy together.
9 Let them sing before Yahweh,
 for he comes to judge the earth.
 He will judge the world with righteousness,
 and the peoples with equity.
