1 Yahweh, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty;
 nor do I concern myself with great matters,
 or things too wonderful for me.
2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,
 like a weaned child with his mother,
 like a weaned child is my soul within me.
3 Israel, hope in Yahweh,
 from this time forward and forever more.
