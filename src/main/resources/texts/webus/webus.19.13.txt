1 How long, Yahweh?
 Will you forget me forever?
 How long will you hide your face from me?
2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
 having sorrow in my heart every day?
 How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
3 Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.
 Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
4 lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”
 lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.
5 But I trust in your loving kindness.
 My heart rejoices in your salvation.
6 I will sing to Yahweh,
 because he has been good to me.
