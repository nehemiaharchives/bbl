1 I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.
 I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”
2 I was mute with silence.
 I held my peace, even from good.
 My sorrow was stirred.
3 My heart was hot within me.
 While I meditated, the fire burned.
 I spoke with my tongue:
4 “Yahweh, show me my end,
 what is the measure of my days.
 Let me know how frail I am.
5 Behold, you have made my days hand widths.
 My lifetime is as nothing before you.
 Surely every man stands as a breath.” Selah.
6 “Surely every man walks like a shadow.
 Surely they busy themselves in vain.
 He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.
7 Now, Lord, what do I wait for?
 My hope is in you.
8 Deliver me from all my transgressions.
 Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.
9 I was mute.
 I didn’t open my mouth,
 because you did it.
10 Remove your scourge away from me.
 I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
11 When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,
 you consume his wealth like a moth.
 Surely every man is but a breath.” Selah.
12 “Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.
 Don’t be silent at my tears.
 For I am a stranger with you,
 a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
 before I go away and exist no more.”
