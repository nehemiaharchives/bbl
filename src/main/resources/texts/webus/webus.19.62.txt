1 My soul rests in God alone.
 My salvation is from him.
2 He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress.
 I will never be greatly shaken.
3 How long will you assault a man?
 Would all of you throw him down,
 like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
4 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.
 They delight in lies.
 They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone,
 for my expectation is from him.
6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.
 I will not be shaken.
7 My salvation and my honor is with God.
 The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
8 Trust in him at all times, you people.
 Pour out your heart before him.
 God is a refuge for us. Selah.
9 Surely men of low degree are just a breath,
 and men of high degree are a lie.
 In the balances they will go up.
 They are together lighter than a breath.
10 Don’t trust in oppression.
 Don’t become vain in robbery.
 If riches increase,
 don’t set your heart on them.
11 God has spoken once;
 twice I have heard this,
 that power belongs to God.
12 Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,
 for you reward every man according to his work.
