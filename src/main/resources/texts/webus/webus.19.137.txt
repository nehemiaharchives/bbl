1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.
 Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
2 On the willows in that land,
 we hung up our harps.
3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.
 Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:
 “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
4 How can we sing Yahweh’s song in a foreign land?
5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,
 let my right hand forget its skill.
6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you,
 if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
7 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,
 who said, “Raze it!
 Raze it even to its foundation!”
8 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,
 he will be happy who repays you,
 as you have done to us.
9 Happy shall he be,
 who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
