1 God is our refuge and strength,
 a very present help in trouble.
2 Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes,
 though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
3 though its waters roar and are troubled,
 though the mountains tremble with their swelling. Selah.
4 There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,
 the holy place of the tents of the Most High.
5 God is within her. She shall not be moved.
 God will help her at dawn.
6 The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.
 He lifted his voice and the earth melted.
7 Yahweh of Armies is with us.
 The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
8 Come, see Yahweh’s works,
 what desolations he has made in the earth.
9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.
 He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.
 He burns the chariots in the fire.
10 “Be still, and know that I am God.
 I will be exalted among the nations.
 I will be exalted in the earth.”
11 Yahweh of Armies is with us.
 The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
