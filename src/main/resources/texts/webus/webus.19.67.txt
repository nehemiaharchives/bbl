1 May God be merciful to us, bless us,
 and cause his face to shine on us. Selah.
2 That your way may be known on earth,
 and your salvation among all nations,
3 let the peoples praise you, God.
 Let all the peoples praise you.
4 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
 for you will judge the peoples with equity,
 and govern the nations on earth. Selah.
5 Let the peoples praise you, God.
 Let all the peoples praise you.
6 The earth has yielded its increase.
 God, even our own God, will bless us.
7 God will bless us.
 All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
