1 <A Song of degrees.> Blessed [is] every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well with thee.
3 Thy wife [shall be] as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, [and] peace upon Israel.
