1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.
2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.
3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:
4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
5 A wise man [is] strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors [there is] safety.
7 Wisdom [is] too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
9 The thought of foolishness [is] sin: and the scorner [is] an abomination to men.
10 [If] thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength [is] small.
11 If thou forbear to deliver [them that are] drawn unto death, and [those that are] ready to be slain;
12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider [it]? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth [not] he know [it]? and shall [not] he render to [every] man according to his works?
13 My son, eat thou honey, because [it is] good; and the honeycomb, [which is] sweet to thy taste:
14 So [shall] the knowledge of wisdom [be] unto thy soul: when thou hast found [it], then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
15 Lay not wait, O wicked [man], against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:
16 For a just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
18 Lest the LORD see [it], and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
19 Fret not thyself because of evil [men], neither be thou envious at the wicked;
20 For there shall be no reward to the evil [man]; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: [and] meddle not with them that are given to change:
22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
23 These [things] also [belong] to the wise. [It is] not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou [art] righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
25 But to them that rebuke [him] shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
26 [Every man] shall kiss [his] lips that giveth a right answer.
27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.
28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive [not] with thy lips.
29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, [and] nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
32 Then I saw, [and] considered [it] well: I looked upon [it, and] received instruction.
33 [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
34 So shall thy poverty come [as] one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
